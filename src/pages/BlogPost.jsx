          “Fast Company”. <br /> <br />
          The digital transformation journey started back in 2015, when KW
          decided to reposition itself as a tech company. The company invested
          heavily in its own software, the cloud, and AI. It has scooped up top
          talent from the market and created its own Labs division, KW Labs. KW
          Labs acts as the innovation hub of Keller Williams, working in a
          similar fashion to Google and Amazon.
          <br /> <br />
          To stay ahead of competitors, Keller Williams have also undertaken one
          of the most ambitious projects in the industry – to leverage their
          data to boost artificial intelligence-powered technology.
