              started back in 2015, when KW decided to reposition itself as a
              tech company. The company invested heavily in its own software,
              the cloud, and AI. It has scooped up top talent from the market
              and created its own Labs division, KW Labs. KW Labs acts as the
              innovation hub of Keller Williams, working in a similar fashion to
              Google and Amazon. <br /> <br /> To stay ahead of competitors,
              Keller Williams have also undertaken one of the most ambitious
              projects in the industry – to leverage their data to boost
              artificial intelligence-powered technology.
